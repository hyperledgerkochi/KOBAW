Association Wallet is a searchable database, where the verifiable credentials of associations under the jurisdiction of Kochi are stored in a decentralized manner. The KOBAW provides all the services offered by a Association authorized to work in Kochi. If a citizen want to be part in an association then, a request for enrolling is moved from the KOB Connect App to KOB Association Wallet. KOBAW process various claim requests. A claims holder (Association or KOBAW) would be expected to contain the following requirements: DIDs (references to decentralized IDs) that make up the wallet owner's identity, and context of those DIDs - e.g. for pair-wise DIDs, the connection to which that DID applies.

If one citizen / organization wants to access the services provided by these associations, they have to undergo a series of verification processes. Or if someone has to get membership from any of these associations, it is a problem to prove their identity. To get an association to be established they also have to go through many paperwork thus consuming much time and effort. The traditional way of storing all information about these associations is also a problem. Our aim is to streamline all the services provided by the associations working under the jurisdiction of Kochi, and to build transparency in accessing these services.

It uses DIDs that enables peer-to-peer, secure messaging between two parties without a centralized authority. VCs are unforgeable digital versions of paper documents that we receive today. Using Identity Registry verifiers do not need to go to the original issuer to verify the information, instead we can use the proof provided by the holder combined with public cryptographic keys provided by an identity registry, which is usually implemented as a public blockchain. The KOB Association Wallet is designed for enterprises to store the identity information in a decentralized way. The users can access the services from anywhere at any time, making the wallet a user compatible facility. The Association wallet safeguard sensitive data: key pairs of associations, zero-knowledge proof blinded secrets, verifiable credentials of the associations, and any other cryptographic material needed to establish and maintain technical trust.","title":"Solution"},{"location":"target.html","text":"The main target audience of Association Wallet are the Registered organisations/ associations in the city of Kochi such as: Bar Councils Cultural Societies Universities RTO Management Associations Medical Associations Drivers Associations","title":"Target Audience"},{"location":"usecase.html","text":"The KOB Association Wallet is a searchable database.

For example, an association might need to prove they are a registered entity, have a tax number, and insurance. An association applies for the credential, typing information about the pre-requisites and any other data needed by the service before reviewing the application. Normally, the association would also pay a fee for the application process and/or for the authorization itself. The person submitting the application might also need to prove they have the authority to act on behalf of the applying association. The service validates the application information provided and makes a decision to issue (or not) the authorization to the association. If the authorization is approved, the service provides the association with a document - a permit/ licence/ registration - that they can use to prove to others that the association has that authority. The association might display the authorization on the wall and/or might take it to others to prove it was issued. For example to a bank for use in a business loan application process. All these authorized associations are stored in the association wallet, and each association is a part of the KOB verifiable Organization Network. If a citizen want to be part of an association, first he establishes a connection to KOBAW through the KOB Connect App. Citizen will have all their proofs in their KOBConnect Wallet. Satisfying the required proofs will allow the citizen to be part of an association and these are done by the approving authority. All the details of these verifiable credentials and proofs are stored in the KOB VCR(Verifiable Credential Registry). The KOB Association wallet, KOB Verifiable Credential Register, KOB Verifiable Organization Network and other services are hosted in the Community Cloud Of Kochi OrgBook (KOBCC)","title":"Workflow"}]}
