
The KOB Association Wallet is an online directory for Associations. It uses DIDs that enables peer-to-peer, secure messaging between two parties without a centralized authority. VCs are unforgeable digital versions of paper documents that we receive today. Using Identity Registry verifiers do not need to go to the original issuer to verify the information, instead we can use the proof provided by the holder combined with public cryptographic keys provided by an identity registry, which is usually implemented as a public blockchain. The KOB Association Wallet is designed for enterprises to store the identity information in a decentralized way. The users can access the services from anywhere at any time, making the wallet a user compatible facility. The Association wallet safeguard sensitive data: key pairs of associations, zero-knowledge proof blinded secrets, verifiable credentials of the associations, and any other cryptographic material needed to establish and maintain technical trust.
