 
There are many associations working under the jurisdiction of Kochi. If one citizen / organization wants to access the services provided by these associations, they have to undergo a series of verification processes. Or if someone has to get membership from any of these associations, it is a problem to prove their identity. To get an association to be established they also have to go through many paperwork thus consuming much time and effort. The traditional way of storing all information about these associations is also a problem. Our aim is to streamline all the services provided by the associations working under the jurisdiction of Kochi, and to build transparency in accessing these services. KochiOrgBook (KOB) is a Digital Trust Ecosystem project for the city of Kochi
