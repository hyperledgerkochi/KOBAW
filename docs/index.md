# The KochiOrgBook Association Wallet 

## Abstract

KochiOrgBook Association Wallet(KOBAW) is an online directory that makes finding authentic and authoritative data about associations faster and easier. Association Wallet is a  searchable database, where the verifiable credentials of associations under the jurisdiction of Kochi are stored in a decentralized manner. The KOBAW provides all the services offered by a Association authorized to work in Kochi. If a citizen want to be part in an association then, a request for enrolling is moved from the KOB Connect App to KOB Association Wallet. KOBAW process various claim requests.

A claims holder (Association or KOBAW) would be expected to contain the following requirements:

* DIDs (references to decentralized IDs) that make up the wallet owner's identity, and context of those DIDs - e.g. for pair-wise DIDs, the connection to which that DID applies.
* The DIDs of your connections (e.g. your banks, stores, government services and so on)
* Verifiable credentials issued to you.
* Cryptographic materials - public and private keys associated with your DIDs, and possibly other materials such as (in the HL-Indy world) your Master Secret for requesting claims (to issuers) and providing proofs (to verifiers)

The KOBAW hold pieces of data(Veriable credentials of Associations) to be used for the  operations like accessing the services offered by various associations in the jurisdiction of Kochi. All the association are part of the KOB Verifiable Organization Network(KOB VON). These informations are stored in the KOB verifiable Credential Registry(KOB VCR).
